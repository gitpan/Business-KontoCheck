Business::KontoCheck version 4.4
================================

This module checks the validity of German and Austrian Bank Account Numbers.
All currently defined test methods by Deutsche Bundesbank (currently: 00 to
E0, February 2013) are implemented.

The Österreichische Bundesbank uses a quite different approach. The basic
tests are more generic; the concrete tests are described by the hash file,
which is sold by SIX Card Solutions Austria GmbH, Wien. Specifications may be
downloaded from http://www.six-card-solutions.at/downloads.asp

The original library is a C library; the Perl port was build using the h2xs
tool.

If you want support only for german or only for austrian Bank Account Numbers,
edit line 15 of Makefile.PL. To use only the german module, use
-DINCLUDE_KONTO_CHECK_AT=0, to use only the austrian module, use
-DINCLUDE_KONTO_CHECK_DE=0.

A longer description and the history file are included as 00liesmich.txt and
0_history.txt (both in german). The C library is available from
http://www.informatik.hs-mannheim.de/konto_check


DOCUMENTATION

short description of (most) export functions is included in the file

command "perldoc Businesss::KontoCheck".
