        4 supported character sets now (ISO 8859-1, UTF-8, DOS CP-850
        and HTML entities); also the encoding of output can be changed.
      - fast initialization of search routines (index blocks in lutfile)
      - the blacklist for IBAN generation (available from Sparkasse) is now supported
      - changes for check methods B6 and D1 (valid from 2011-09-05) are implemented

        failed completely (before the 3.2 release, they were not coverd by the test routines).
